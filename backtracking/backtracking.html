    <font size="6"> <b>Backtracking</b></font> <br>
    <font> Copyright Â©2002 by David Matuszek</font>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you
        make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you
        made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of
        choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though
        it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with
        the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most
        recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the
        choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left,
        there are no good leaves to be found.
    </p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>
    <img src="./treesearch.gif" alt="image not found" style="margin-left: 600px;">
    <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li> At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li> At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li> At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li> At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li> E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices
        we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell
        us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called
        <i>depth-first tree searching.</i> )
    </p>
    <h3>The backtracking algorithm.</h3>
    <p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node n:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <pre> "boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            } else {
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false
            }
        }</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a <i>boolean</i> function. This is essential to understanding the
        algorithm. <code> If solve(n) </code> is true, that means node <code>n</code> is part of a solution--that is,
        node <code>n</code> is one of the nodes on
        a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is <i> solvable</i>. <code> If solve(n) </code>is false,
        then
        there is no path
        that includes <code>n</code> to any goal node.</p>
    <p>How does this work?


    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li> If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node <code>n</code> is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you
        have to do is
        test whether any child of <code>n</code> is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of <code>n</code>.
        In the
        above code, this
        is done by the lines
    </p>
    <pre>
        for each child c of n {
            if solve(c) succeeds, return true
        }
        return false
    </pre>
    <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if
        the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by
        the lines</p>
    <pre>
        if n is a leaf node {
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
        }
    </pre>
    <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating
        it is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To search a tree:
        </li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node,
        </li>
        <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched them
            all unsuccessfully.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack

    </h3>
    <p> Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack
        algorithm. In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.</p>
    <pre>boolean solve(Node n) {
    put node n on the stack;
    while the stack is not empty {
        if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
            if it is a goal node, return true
            else pop it off the stack
        }
        else {
            if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                push the next untried child onto the stack
            else pop the node off the stack

    }
    return false
}</pre>
    <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently
        on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all
        times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have
        no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there
        must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.
    </p>
    <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the
        root to a goal node.</p>
    <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in
        the sequence of recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by
        (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or storing it in an array.</p>
    <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the
        successful path:</p>
    <pre>boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node {
                   print n
                   return true
                }
                else return false
            } else {
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds {
                        print n
                        return true
                    }
                }
                return false
            }
        }
        </pre>
    <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
    <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they
        can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex: for
        example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and
        stalemate solutions.</p>
    <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example,
        you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b><code> gameOver </code></b> method (or you could even
        call it
        <b><code> isLeaf</code></b>). This
        method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
    </p>
    <p>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its
        children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look
        simple, by just saying <code>for each child </code> c of n. In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what
        the possible
        children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can represent
        one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement after some
        piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've
        already examined?</p>
    <p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon
        initial entry to the node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As
        you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and
        you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.</p>
    <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried,<b> if </b> you can define an ordering on
        the children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to
        try next.</p>
    <p>For example, you might be able to number the children <code>1</code> through <code>n</code> , and try them in
        numerical order. Then, if you
        have just tried <code>child k</code>, you know that you have already tried children <code>1</code> through
        <code>k-1</code> , and you have
        not yet tried
        children <code>k+1</code> through <code>n</code>. Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four colors,
        you can always try red
        first, then yellow, then green, then blue. If child yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you are
        searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right (or perhaps north, east, south, west).
    </p>
    <p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. In the chess game example, you might
        number your pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each
        piece may also have several moves, and these must also be ordered.</p>
    <p>You can probably find some way to order the children of a node. If the ordering scheme is simple enough, you
        should use it; but if it is too cumbersome, you are better off keeping a list of untried children.

    </p>
    <h3>Example: TreeSearch</h3>
    <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will
        also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.</p>
    <p>A <b>binary tree</b> is a data structure composed of <b> nodes</b>. One node is designated as the <b>root
            node</b> . Each node can
        reference (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its <b>children</b> . The children are
        referred to
        as the <b>left child</b> and/or the <b> right child</b> . All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from
        the root node, and
        there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say
        that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which
        we repeat here) shows a binary tree.

    </p>
    <img src="./treesearch.gif" alt="image can't load" style="margin-left: 600px;">
    <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>
    <pre>
        public class BinaryTree {
            BinaryTree leftChild = null;
            BinaryTree rightChild = null;
            boolean isGoalNode = false;
            String name;
            
            BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
                this.name = name;
                leftChild = left;
                rightChild = right;
                this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
            }
        }
    
    </pre>
    <p>Next we will create a <b> TreeSearch</b> class, and in it we will define a method <b> makeTree()</b> which
        constructs the above binary tree.</p>
    <pre>static BinaryTree makeTree() {
            BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
            c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
            d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);
            e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);
            f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);
            a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
            b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);
            root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);
            return root;
        }</pre>
    <p>
        Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:



    </p>
    <pre>public static void main(String args[]) {
            BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
            System.out.println(solvable(tree));
        }</pre>
    <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
    <pre>
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
          <span style="color: blue;">/* 1 */</span> if (node == null) return false;
          <span style="color: blue;">/* 2 */</span> if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
          <span style="color: blue;">/* 3 */</span>  if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
          <span style="color: blue;">/* 4 */</span>  if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
          <span style="color: blue;">/* 5 */</span>  return false;
            }
    </pre>
    <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>f we are given a null <b>node</b>, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with
            the
            children of a <b>node</b>, without first checking whether those children actually exist.
        </li>
        <li> If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li>
        <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that <b>node</b> is solvable. We will only
            get to
            this line if node is non-null and is not a goal <b>node</b>, says to</li>
        <li> Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
        <li> Since neither child of node is solvable, <b>node</b> itself is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
